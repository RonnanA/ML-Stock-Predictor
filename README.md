# Machine Learning Stock Predictor
This project is a machine learning model designed to predict whether the S&P 500 stock price will trend up or down based on historical market data. Using Python, Scikit-Learn, Pandas, and yfinance, the model analyzes past price movements to generate predictions about future trends.

# Overview
Stock market prediction is a challenging task due to the complexity of financial data and the appearance of non-linear patterns. This project is a simple prediction model that aims to predict whether the S&P 500 will trend up or down by leveraging historical stock prices and applying machine learning techniques. The model takes in historical data, extracts relevant features, and predicts whether the S&P 500 will experience an upward or downward trend. The goal of this project is to grasp the basics of machine learning and apply these techniques to real-world problems. This simple model trained on just historical data can achieve nearly 60% accuracy.

# Features
- Data Collection: Uses yfinance to get historical stock data for the S&P 500.
- Data Processing: Cleans and structures the data using Pandas for efficient analysis.
- Feature Engineering: Extracts meaningful features from stock price data to enhance model performance.
- Machine Learning Model: Implements the RandomForestClassifier model by Scikit-Learn to predict non-linear market trends.
- Evaluation: Assesses the modelâ€™s accuracy and performance using various metrics.

# Limitations
While machine learning can help identify patterns in stock price movements, it does not guarantee accuracy due to certain factors that cannot be identified by historical data alone.
